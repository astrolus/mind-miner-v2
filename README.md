## About Mind-Miner

Mind-Miner is an interactive Web3 game that transforms passive content consumption into an active, engaging, and rewarding experience. Players are challenged to embark on a "knowledge hunt" within Reddit. The game provides an AI-generated clue leading to a specific fact hidden within a Reddit post. The user's goal is to find the exact comment or permalink containing the answer.

Successful discoveries are not just for glory; they are rewarded with **Testnet ALGO cryptocurrency**, and players can earn unique **Algorand NFT trophies** as verifiable achievements for their knowledge-mining skills. Mind-Miner combines the power of AI for clue generation and fact verification with blockchain technology for tangible digital rewards and ownership.

## Live Demo

## Key Features

  * **Algorand Wallet Integration:** Seamlessly connect your Pera Wallet (via Web or QR code) to interact with the game.
  * **AI-Powered Clues:** Receive cryptic hints generated by AI to guide your knowledge hunt.
  * **Reddit Integration:** Navigate to real Reddit posts and identify the specific comments that hold the answers.
  * **Crypto Rewards:** Earn Testnet ALGO cryptocurrency for successfully completing hunts.
  * **NFT Trophies (Planned/Partial):** Collect unique Algorand NFT achievements for specific milestones and discoveries.
  * **Game Flow:** A complete core loop from wallet connection, starting a hunt, clue display, submission, and displaying hunt results.
  * **Dynamic Messaging:** In-app messages to guide the user through wallet connection, hunt initiation, and submission feedback.

## Tech Stack

Mind-Miner is a full-stack application built with modern web technologies:

  * **Frontend:**
      * **Next.js 13.5.1 (App Router):** React framework for server-side rendering and routing.
      * **TypeScript:** For type safety and robust code.
      * **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid, utility-first styling.
      * **Shadcn/ui:** Reusable UI components built on Radix UI.
      * **Framer Motion:** For smooth, engaging animations.
      * **Axios:** HTTP client for API requests.
      * **Pera Wallet Connect SDK:** Facilitates secure Algorand wallet connections.
  * **Backend (Next.js API Routes):**
      * **Node.js/Express-style API routes:** Handled within Next.js for server-side logic.
      * **TypeScript:** Consistent with the frontend.
      * **Axios:** For external API calls.
      * **Algorand SDK (`algosdk`):** For blockchain interactions (e.g., potential NFT minting, token distribution).
  * **Database:**
      * **Supabase (PostgreSQL):** Used for database management (users, game sessions) and backend-as-a-service.
      * **Supabase Client Library:** For secure database interactions.
  * **Third-Party Integrations:**
      * **AI Service (e.g., OpenAI API):** For clue generation and fact verification.
      * **Reddit API:** To interact with Reddit content.
      * **Algorand Blockchain:** The underlying blockchain for crypto rewards and NFTs (TestNet).

## How We Built It

Mind-Miner was developed with an agile and iterative approach, focusing on delivering core functionality first. We established a robust Next.js project structure, separating concerns between the frontend UI, backend API routes, and database interactions.

We prioritized a seamless user experience, particularly around the Web3 wallet connection, and designed a clear data flow between the client, our Next.js API, and the Supabase database. The integration of various external APIs (AI, Reddit, Algorand) was handled carefully, ensuring proper data exchange and error management. Core game loops, from initiation to submission, were built out to create a cohesive playable experience.

## Challenges & Learning

  * **API Orchestration:** Integrating and managing data flow between disparate services like AI, Reddit, Algorand, and Supabase required careful handling of asynchronous operations, authentication, and varied response structures.
  * **Blockchain State Management:** Ensuring the Pera Wallet connection remained stable and handling various wallet states and potential transaction signing flows.
  * **AI Prompt Engineering:** Iterating on prompts to achieve effective and accurate clue generation and fact verification from the AI service.
  * **Hackathon Time Constraints:** Making strategic decisions on feature prioritization and scope to deliver a functional core product within a limited timeframe.

Through these challenges, we gained deeper practical experience with full-stack Web3 development, robust API integration strategies, and the nuances of building a gamified blockchain application.

## Accomplishments

  * **Full Core Game Loop:** Successfully implemented the end-to-end user journey from wallet connection, starting a hunt, displaying clues, handling submissions, and showing results.
  * **Live Deployment:** Successfully deployed the application to `mindminer.site`, making it publicly accessible and demonstrable.
  * **Seamless Web3 Integration:** Established smooth and intuitive Algorand wallet connectivity using Pera Wallet Connect.
  * **Robust Backend & Database:** Built a well-structured Next.js API layer backed by a functional Supabase (PostgreSQL) database.
  * **Ambitious Tech Stack:** Effectively combined cutting-edge technologies like AI, blockchain, and modern web frameworks into a cohesive product.

## What's Next for Mind Miner

Mind-Miner has a vast potential for expansion:

  * **Advanced AI Integration:** Exploring more sophisticated AI for personalized clue difficulty, dynamic hunt generation, and even community-driven clue creation.
  * **Enhanced Blockchain Features:** Full implementation of ALGO token distribution for rewards, more diverse NFT trophies with potential in-game utility, and perhaps even decentralized governance for game rules or content curation.
  * **Competitive Features:** Implementing comprehensive leaderboards, daily challenges, and social features like friend invites and direct hunt challenges.
  * **Multi-Platform Content:** Expanding beyond Reddit to other knowledge sources or social media platforms.
  * **Mobile Application:** Developing native mobile apps for an even more seamless experience.
  * **Monetization & Sustainability:** Exploring premium hunt options, rare NFT drops, or community contributions.
